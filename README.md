# 1.What does the len() function do in Python? Write a code example using len() to find the length of a list.

# A. The len() function is used to determine the length or number of items in a collection such as string, tuple, sets,
#    dictionaries or lists. It returns an integer representing the length of the given object.

l1 = list(range(1,7))
print(l1,type(l1),len(l1))

# 2.Write a Python function greet(name) that takes a person's name as input and prints "Hello, [name]!".

def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

name = str(input("Enter the name: "))
greet(name)

# 3.Write a Python function find_maximum(numbers) that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum value
#   without using the built-in max() function. Use a loop to iterate through the list and compare values.

def find_maximum(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None

    max_value = numbers[0]
    for number in numbers:
        if number > max_value:
            max_value = number
    return max_value

numbers = [3, 5, 2, 10, 1]
print(find_maximum(numbers))

# 4.Explain the difference between local and global variables in a Python function. Write a program where a
#   global variable and a local variable have the same name and show how Python differentiates between them.

# A. Python Global variables are those which are not defined inside any function and have a global scope. They are defined
# outside any function and are accessible throughout the program.

# Python local variables are defined inside a function and their scope is limited inside that function alone. They are
# only accessible inside the function.

# Local variable
def l():
    s = "My name is Nabil"
    print(s)

l()

# Local variable called outside
l()
print(s)

# Global variable
def g():
    print("Inside Function",s)

s = "My name is Nabil"
g()
print("Outside Function",s)

# 5.Create a function calculate_area(length, width=5) that calculates the area of a rectangle. If only the length is
#   provided, the function should assume the width is 5. Show how the function behaves when called with and without
#   the width argument.

def area_of_rectangle(length):
    width = 5
    area = length * width
    return(area)

length_of_rectangle = int(input("Enter length: "))
AreaOfRectangle = area_of_rectangle(length_of_rectangle)
print(f"The area of rectangle with length {length_of_rectangle} units is {AreaOfRectangle} square units.")

If width = 5 line is turned into a comment, we get the following output:
